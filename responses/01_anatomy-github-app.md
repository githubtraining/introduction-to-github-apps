### What do apps need?

**Every GitHub App needs:**
- A place to call home (deployment)
- Defined patterns to look for, like "closing an issue", or "assigning yourself to this issue"
- A monitoring system, to make sure it's bug-free

Next up, let's look at a real live GitHub app! Close this issue and I'll meet you in a pull request so that we can experiment.
