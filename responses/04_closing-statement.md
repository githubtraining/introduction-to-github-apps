## Configure your app

Hey, `request info` app! Good to see you here. And great advice!

Anyways, {{user}}, did you see what happened there?

`Request info` chimed in with their default message, and the WIP app didn't react at all. Remember that apps use webhooks, designed to send data after specific events.

### Configuration files

The last thing I want to draw your attention to is the `.yml` file. Some apps use these, and some don't use them at all. Some apps might use a `.json` file, others might ask you to store configuration settings in a `.md` file.
