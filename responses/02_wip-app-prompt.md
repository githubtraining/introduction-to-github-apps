# Install a GitHub App

[Probot](https://probot.github.io/) is the basis of some of the coolest GitHub Apps out there. Most [Probot apps](https://probot.github.io/docs/) are already hosted, easy to install, and easy to discover.

Here are a few examples of things built with Probot:

- **[Stale](https://probot.github.io/apps/stale/)**: Closes issues and PRs that have been around for a bit too long without activity
- **[Delete merged branch](https://probot.github.io/apps/delete-merged-branch/)**: After a merge, deletes the branch
- **[First timers](https://probot.github.io/apps/first-timers/)**: Creates an issue to help onboard new open source contributors to your community

We're going to start by installing the **[WIP Probot App](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/)**. Make sure to install this app on this repo only, and don't apply it to everything you have access to.
