# Welcome to GitHub Learning Lab's "Introduction to GitHub Apps"

Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way.

### Application vs GitHub Application

There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on **GitHub applications**, apps designed to work on GitHub.

### How does this work on GitHub?

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality.  With webhooks and GitHub's APIs, GitHub apps can customize your experience.

GitHub apps are top-layer tools that simplify regular or repetitive processes.

We'll look at some real examples very soon in this course.
