# Welcome to Getting started with GitHub Apps

We're going to work together to learn about GitHub Apps! We'll do this in this repository, which is a collection of resources - _games_ to be specific. Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way.

### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

## Application vs GitHub Application
There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on **GitHub Applications**, apps designed to work on GitHub.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality through webhooks and GitHub's APIs. GitHub Apps act as top-layer tools that you can use to customize and automate routine processes.

Please note that GitHub Apps are very different from OAuth Apps. These have a different installation flow and have different rules around how they handle their data and access. If you'd like to learn more, check out the documentation on [the differences between GitHub and OAuth Apps](https://developer.github.com/apps/differences-between-apps/).

## Step 1: Get familiar with GitHub Apps

To learn more about GitHub Apps, you will install two on this repository. Make sure to install the apps on **this** repository only. Don't apply them to everything you have access to.
