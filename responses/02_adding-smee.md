Nice job! Something changed on this repo when you added the "WIP" command. Let's try to get more insight into our app before we look at those changes.

## Breaking down the WIP app components

- **Electricity**: Since this is a Probot app, the power to run comes from deployment, set up by the app creators. We don't need to worry about this until we build an app ourselves.
- **Standard behaviors**: GitHub has a list of [documented events](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/about-webhooks#events) that can alert an app.
- **Location**: Apps are designed to look for pre-determined events in whichever repositories they've been installed. On installation, it has to ask permission for each event type that it wants to monitor.
- **Notification service**: If the expected action occurs, a notification delivery is sent to the app as a webhook payload -- a specific set of data transmitted via GitHub's API.

GitHub Apps will then process this data in the background, responding to the repository with their expected default actions.

## Step 3:  Looking under the hood

For the next exercise, let's add our own notification service to get a better idea of what apps are receiving behind the scenes.
