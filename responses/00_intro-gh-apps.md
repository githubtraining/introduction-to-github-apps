# Welcome to Getting started with GitHub Apps

Before we start using real GitHub applications, let's get some foundations out of the way.

### New to GitHub? 

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out the [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

## Application vs GitHub Application
There are many types of applications, like the apps you might have on your phone. In this course, we'll focus on **GitHub Applications**, apps designed to work on GitHub.

GitHub Apps allow you to change GitHub's surface-level functionality. With webhooks and GitHub's APIs, GitHub Apps act as top-layer tools that you can use to customize and automate routine processes.

## Installing a GitHub App

To learn more about GitHub Apps, let's install the **[WIP Probot app](https://probot.github.io/apps/wip/)** to this repository. "WIP" is a common abbreviation to mean **work in progress**. Make sure to install this app on this repository only. Don't apply it to everything you have access to.

It's also important to mention that GitHub Apps are not people. You can't interact with them by doing things like using an @mention, or assigning them to review your work. 

Let's get started by installing the app and then assigning yourself to the pull request so I know you're ready to continue.
