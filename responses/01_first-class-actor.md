Nice work. Now, let's talk about how this fits together in software development.

### GitHub Apps and OAuth Apps

Integrations on GitHub can be one of two types: **OAuth Apps** or **GitHub Apps**.

| OAuth App   | GitHub App    |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| Installed on all of a user's or organization's repositories      | Installed on a specific repository for a specific purpose
| Always acts as the authenticated user across GitHub     | Limited capabilities, less than what a user would have

Remember, this course is all about **GitHub apps**.

1. Try to assign me, `Lab`, to this issue.
1. Notice that you can't? That's because I'm a **GitHub app**, not a real user.
